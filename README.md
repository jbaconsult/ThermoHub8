# ThermoHub8 ‚Äì Open Source Modular Temperature Hub

ThermoHub8 is an open-source hardware and software project designed to connect **up to 8 temperature sensors** (via Modbus/RS-485) to an **ESP32** microcontroller.  
The device publishes all sensor readings through a **REST API** and integrates seamlessly with **Home Assistant** via a custom integration.

The goal of this project is to provide a **reliable, local, and customizable temperature monitoring system** for smart home and industrial environments ‚Äî with **no cloud dependency**.

---

## üß© Project Overview

ThermoHub8 consists of three major parts:

1. **ESP32 Firmware**  
   - Communicates via Modbus (RS-485) with up to 8 PT1000 temperature sensors  
   - Serves a local REST API (`/api/v1/readings`)  
   - Includes a built-in web UI for naming sensors  
   - Displays readings on an LCD (16x4 I¬≤C display)  
   - Supports joystick control for local navigation  

2. **Home Assistant Custom Integration**  
   - Polls the ThermoHub8 REST API  
   - Displays all 8 sensors as entities in Home Assistant  
   - Allows configuration via UI (Config Flow)  
   - Supports custom update intervals, API key, and SSL settings  

3. **Hardware Assembly**  
   - Based on ESP32 + MAX485 converter  
   - Uses Modbus PT1000 sensor modules  
   - LCD display and joystick for local display and control  
   - Powered via DC converter (e.g., 12V ‚Üí 5V)

## üß∞ Firmware

The firmware is written in **C++ (Arduino / ESP32)** and uses the following libraries:

- `ESPAsyncWebServer`
- `AsyncTCP`
- `ModbusMaster`
- `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
- `ArduinoJson`

### Features:
- Single Modbus slave (configurable ID)
- Reads 8 float values (32-bit) from 16 registers
- REST API endpoint: `/api/v1/readings`
- Web interface for naming sensors (`/`)
- Persistent storage via `Preferences` (NVS)
- LCD navigation with joystick input
- Logging via Serial output

Firmware source:  
`/firmware/thermohub8_esp32/`

Example JSON output:

```json
{
  "sensors": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Living Room", "value": 21.3, "unit": "¬∞C" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bedroom", "value": 19.8, "unit": "¬∞C" }
  ],
  "ts": "2025-09-15T12:34:56Z"
}
```

## üè† Home Assistant Integration

A dedicated Home Assistant integration (`custom_components/thermohub8/`) is included.

### Key Features
- Auto-discovery of all 8 sensors  
- Adjustable polling interval (1‚Äì60 s)  
- Configurable base URL, SSL verification, and API key  
- Logging and diagnostics support  

Integration documentation:  
[`/homeassistant/README_ThermoHub8.md`](./homeassistant/README_ThermoHub8.md)

## ‚ö° Power Supply

- Input: 12 V DC (typical)
- Conversion: via DC-DC step-down converter (to 5 V DC)
- Powering ESP32, LCD, MAX485, and sensors
- Typical power draw: 150‚Äì250 mA depending on LCD backlight and Modbus load

---

## üß± Assembly Notes

- Keep RS-485 wiring twisted and shielded for stability.  
- Terminate RS-485 bus with 120 Œ© resistors on both ends.  
- Use short, clean I¬≤C and analog lines for the joystick and display.  
- Mount ESP32 on a perforated PCB or custom carrier board.
